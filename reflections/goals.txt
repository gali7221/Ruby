I am very eager to run into the Web Development world and create an app connecting people in some of their endeavours. 

I want to be completely and fully confident that I can jump into any position after finishing the Ruby on Rails Course. 

I am definitely interested in a career as a ruby on rails developer, but I have my own endeavours. I hope Udacity can make this dream come true.
